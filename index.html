<h1> Scotty Sheridan - Business Analytics Student @ Georgia Tech </h1>
<br />

Hello! My name is Scotty, and I'm a junior at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Business Administration with a concentration in IT Management and a minor in FinTech. Thanks to the technical skills learned in my classwork, Iâ€™ve held positions at Raymond James Financial and Cognosos, where I used applied data to business problems and uncovered solutions which were backed by analytical tools such as R, Python, and Tableau. I currently act as the Business Manager of Infinite Harmony, Georgia Tech's premier co-ed a capella group, and I'm a Scheller Business Ambassador as well as a peer mentor for MGT 1100, Scheller's first-year seminar class.
